##### Layouts in PyQt

This is a layout module that showcases examples of layouts used in PyQt. Layouts are used to arrange or place user interface 
items such as widgets and labels in a clean and presentable way. However, if not handled carefully they can result in a
messy arrangement of items. The layouts include the following:

1. This is a Horizontal layout. <br /><br /> ![Horizontal layout](../images/horizontal_layout.png)<br /><br />
2. This is a Vertical layout. <br /><br /> ![Vertical layout](../images/vertical_layout.png)<br /><br />
3. This is a Grid layout. <br /><br /> ![Grid layout](../images/grid_layout.png)<br /><br />
   The grid layout (QGridLayout) management row and column mapping appears as shown below for all grid layouts.<br /><br />
   ![Grid layout](../images/grid_layout_1.png)<br /><br />
4. This is a Form layout. <br /><br /> ![Form layout](../images/form_layout.png)<br /><br />
5. This is a Stacked layout.
